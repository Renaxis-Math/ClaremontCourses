        "description": "Archaeology is one of the four primary subdivisions of Anthropology. The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

While the readings cover environmental justice issues widely, we will center our analysis and work around local environmental justice work in the Inland Empire.

In this course we will explore how common narratives of heroism and of the well-lived life shaped the political and cultural histories of the Mediterranean world from 3000 B.C.E. to 400 C.E., from the rise of the earliest Ancient Near Eastern empires through the decline of the Roman Empire. There will be a strong emphasis on engaging with the ancient sources in translation, with readings drawn especially from the genres of epic Homers Iliad, Epic of Gilgamesh, Hesiods Works  Days, historiography Herodotus, Thucydides, Sallust, Livy, Tacitus, and biography Law Code of Hammurabi, Xenophons Agesilaus, Plutarchs Lives, and the Passion of Perpetua.",

The first semester focuses on the connections and distinctions between continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems and their representation in the time and frequency domains. Topics include impulse response, convolution, continuous and discrete Fourier series and transforms, and frequency response. Current applications, including filtering, modulation and sampling, are presented, and simulation techniques based on both time and frequency domain representations are introduced. In the second semester additional analysis and design tools based on the Laplace- and z-transforms are developed, and the state space formulation of continuous and discrete-time systems is presented. Concepts covered during both semesters are applied in a comprehensive treatment of feedback control systems including performance criteria, stability, observability, controllability, compensation and pole placement.

        "title": "Adv Processing of Engr Materials / Special Topics in Engineering",
        "description": "The emphasis of this course is on exposure to the latest or up to date technological literature on advanced processing of engineered materials, critical analysis of the literature, and improvement of communicational skills both oral and written so critical for your career development. You will need to be self-reliant to succeed.Advanced manufacturing is the backbone of most industries and the productivity of anindustry or country depends significantly on the development and implementation of newtechnologies as one faces challenges globally. Much of the technical information on newtechnologies is available in the patent literature U.S. Patents a resource hardly tapped and some fundamental work in the technical literature. Magazine articles and the worldwide web www generally cover the overall features. Students in this course will have an opportunity to explore the latest advances in manufacturing processes first hand, which would otherwise takeyears before it appears in textbooks. Where appropriate, industry experts will provide guest presentations and an on-site tour may be incorporated. No required textbook; only reference material.Topics covered in this course may include, purification of materials electro-slag remelting ESR, vacuum melting, zone refining, melting to remove tramp elements; precision casting; densification of materials conventional sintering, reaction sintering, hot-pressing, hot-isostatic pressing; directional solidification and growth of single crystals Czochralski process and Bridgeman technique; mechanical alloying; liquid phase infiltration; net-shaped finishing; superplastic forming; processing of nanocrystalline materials sol-gel processing; float glass or flat glass processing; tape laying; microwave processing; laser processing; ultraprecision machining UPM and ultraprecision grinding UPG; polishing and lapping; engineered surfaces and surface modification CVD and PVD sputtering and ion plating coatings including multilayer coatings; and layer processing for electronic materials. These and other topics the students may choose are rarely exposed, if at all, and definitely not at the same depth, to typical engineering students. You will receive a list of some 20 case studies as examples and a one-page description of each topic outlining the resources available, such as U. S. Patents or technical literature, as guidelines. You are free to choose any topic from this list or some other topic of interest. In most cases, students pick additional topics. This is an open ended course where students receive the opportunity to select a topic of interest dealing with advanced processing, prepare a patent search, analyze patents, prepare a technical report, and present the results in a power point presentation PPT format to the entire class. This way, in addition to acquiring knowledge on various manufacturing processes and materials, students improve upon their analytical and communicational skills both written and oral. Students have the option to form a team of two or work individually. During the span of the course,-conduct three case studies. Each case study takes 4-5 weeks.-Each week, make a PPT on the progress of your work and-on the last week of each case study, make final presentations and submit technical reports.At the beginning of the course, the students were given a list of anticipated ABET program outcomes. Depending on the topic chosen by a particular student, the relevance of these outcomes vary. At the end of the semester, the students are given a questionnaire, which is essentially the same as the outcomes given at the beginning of the course. The only difference is after each outcome, two items were included, namely, students analysis before and after the course in a scale of 1-10 for self-assessment. These are anonymous and submitted to the Secretary. That way confidentiality is maintained.Prerequisite: Engineering 86.",

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasellos Construction Grammar a theory of the child acquisition of syntax, and an introduction to Chomskys Minimalist Program a theory of adult language syntax. The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data CHILDES. The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included with the expectation that students will have taken at least one. But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they dont have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

This idea is conceived from and directly linked to the foundation of our Spanish program that is based on the concept that language is a social practice. At the same time that students learn and practice grammar structures, they explore various topics related to social justice affecting Spanish-speaking communities locally and abroad. In addition, our local partner organizations and our Study Abroad programs Costa Rica and Ecuador play an important role in achieving this objective through different types of interactions during the semester. Our final goal for Spanish 22 students is to take ownership in their language learning process, to develop awareness of social justice issues, and interact with our Spanish-speaking communities.",

Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.",

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts i.e. the Cold War, 911, Japanese internment affect Asian American gender formations What does the popular Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom have to do with the geo-political U.S. economic relations with Asia How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality",

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and ones place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the essayistic and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the essay does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Agns Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and JaTovia Gary.",

It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see this worldthe actual, real, or historical worldin its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films Hitchcocks Rope and Lamorisses The Red Balloon and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts e.g. T.J. Clark.",

The main focus of the class will be reading significant American novels from the 1790s through the early 20th century. The class will examine how these novels both participated in and were shaped by various social, political, and cultural developments of the long nineteenth century, includingamong many others the contest to define democracy in the early republic, the explosion of writing by and for women in the 1840s and 50s, the antebellum struggles over slavery, and the rise of modern social movements. The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes the American Novel from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as theory of the novel. We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US.

We will explore the readers role as ward, and we will glance at guardianships bearing on histories of slavery, voting rights, and aesthetics, on contemporary problems such as mass incarceration and our failing stewardship of the earth, and on the novel genres many debts to drama.",

        "description": "This course examines the normative and political dilemmas of citizenship and belonging through the lived experiences of Latinoa communities in the United States. Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latinoas since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over illegality further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latinoas have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.",

Pilates is an abdominally based workout that is designed to create postural strength focusing on the abdominal as well as the small intrinsic muscles that support our spinal column. The entire theory of Pilates is developed around the idea of lengthening the muscles as they contract. The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups. The practice of Pilates is designed to stimulate the proper neurological innervation to create a deeper sense of symmetry. PNC only. May be repeated for credit.

Much ofAfrican-American social thought represents different attempts to grapple with American institutionalized racism and its changing face, and the diversity of viewpoints and perspectives we will encounter here will reflect the diverse manifestations of this racism and why being woke requires more than simply using the term to signify understanding.",

It attends to how the hemisperic Americas and Asia Pacific regions have been shaped by the United States and China, respectively and concomitantly. We trace overlapping histories of U.S.-European interventions into Asia Pacific, Pacific militarizations, Chinese empire, and modern Chinese nation-state building led by Han ethnonationalisms. Focusing on transpacific crossings and the production of sinophone cultures in history, popular culture, science, and tourism, this course applies queer analyses to investigate how the U.S. and China produce one another as analogous others.",

Most deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. This course includes two components, 1 geometric data analysis and 2 geometric deep learning. For 1, students will learn geometric aspects of image analysis, pattern analysis and shape analysis and the approach of multivariate statistics that treats arbitrary data sets as clouds of points in n-dimensional space. For 2, students will learn how to apply traditional machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks to 3D objects, graphs and manifolds to solve problems including classifying nodes with similar characteristics on graphs, 3D object classification using point clouds, and 3D shape correspondence on 2D images.

It draws on input from literary texts, discussions in media, presentations in film and other visuals, and experiences in daily life. A key goal of the course is, beyond the broad content focus on questions of race, migration, xenophobia, class, and DEI, to offer an alternative view of these topics beyond the US-American debate. Many students are doubtlessly already acquainted with the latter, and the course provides a new lens on these questions through the cultural historical parameters of a different countryculture.

Histories of the Present: Community.With Histories of the Present, Core I faculty and students will explore the relationship between historically informed critical thinking and our engagement with contemporary issues and debates. Our investigations seek to highlight the categories and values that we may take to be given or obvious and the ways in which the conventional or received understanding and application of these categories and values can prevent us from seeing ourselves and the world--social and natural--in other ways. Core I takes up this task through an examination of communities. Starting with the question What is a community we look at both large imagined communities such as modern nation-states and religious groups and smaller, more intimate groups that we regularly label as a community. We ask: How are communities formed and transformed What role does historical memory and forgetting play in the creation of community How are communities at once inclusive and exclusionary What role do performance and memory play in the formation and transformation of communities Any when are communities beneficial and when are they potentially harmfulIn this course, we examine the ways in which communities are created and transformed through political acts, religious practices, military intervention, cultural performances, social networks, and bonding. In conjunction with this, we critique the ways in which practices of overt and implicit exclusion along the lines of birth, class, race, gender, sexuality, ability, and religious beliefs limit the possibility of belonging. We explore the ways in which individuals and communities define and represent themselves in accordance with and in resistance to the dominant powers that often determine a communitys boundaries. We also explore how communities work in resistance to transform their own and others political, economic and social condition.",

In this class, students explore whether seemingly objective scientific inquiry can be affected by the social and cultural values of the scientific community. Broadly, we will focus on three inter-related topics: i evidence gathering and inductive reasoning, ii science as a value-free enterprise, and iii the nature of technological change through the explosion of big data and machine learning. Through these topics, we examine the values implicit in scientific culture and the extent to which these values do, can, and should guide the development of burgeoning technology.",

One key idea Kierkegaard, Heidegger is that living for the sake of anything social or public alienates an individual from their own lived experience-for example, experience of anxiety about ones finitude. Another key idea is that specific kinds of social relation are alienating, in that they divide an individual internally against themself: Hegel argues that society prior to a modern economy is alienating, but Marx argues that capitalism itself is alienating. Fanon and Beauvoir draw on all this in analyzing racism and sexism. Should we prefer one of these key ideas, both, or neither",

Cases of so-called cognitive penetration, stereotype threat, and implicit bias appear to be cases where background beliefs about social stereotypes and prejudices might unconsciously change and shape the way we view the world around us, the beliefs we form about others, and how we navigate the social world. In this seminar, well address these issues head on and end by discussing the philosophical implications of these psychological phenomena in larger societal domains, including the fair treatment of marginalized groups in many aspects of the social world, in particular academia, machine learning, and the criminal justice system.",

In mapping European and American musics queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowies and Princes gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA roots of Disco and House EDM, and more.

Two areas receive focused attention. The first examines the contrasting and sometimes conflicting Zionist ideologies and the legacy of these ideas as they express themselves in Israel from 1948 to the present. The second focus comes in understanding the ways in which Israel has defined itself as a Jewish state, the role of religion in Israeli politics, law, and society, and the challenges to this identity, including the multiple forms of Jewish identity represented in Israel e.g., secular, Haredi, Mizrahi, and the presence of large numbers of non-Jewish, ArabPalestinian, citizens.",

        "description": "Maps have the power to reveal relationships that are not readily seen, such as uneven impacts of COVID-19, global climate change, environmental pollution, and so on. Geographic Information Systems GIS act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions.  In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are reoriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equit",
