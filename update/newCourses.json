Racial capitalism as a framework recognizes that capitalism is inherently social and that capitalist value production has thrived on the violent and violative production of social and spatial difference and separability. We will learn from interdisciplinary scholars that have asked and investigated how and where categories of difference like race, class, gender, and sexuality are in productive tension with the relations of property, ownership, and capitalist value. We will learn about abolition democracy as a political intellectual model that precedes and exceeds the developmental model of racial capitalism by grounding abolition democracy within Black and Indigenous studies and Gender and Sexuality studies. Abolition democracy is not just a response to racial capitalism and racist violence, but is a way of being and knowing that offers insights to some of our most pressing social concerns.",

            "description": "The emphasis of this course is on exposure to the latest or up to date technological literature on advanced processing of engineered materials, critical analysis of the literature, and improvement of communicational skills both oral and written so critical for your career development. You will need to be self-reliant to succeed.Advanced manufacturing is the backbone of most industries and the productivity of anindustry or country depends significantly on the development and implementation of newtechnologies as one faces challenges globally. Much of the technical information on newtechnologies is available in the patent literature U.S. Patents a resource hardly tapped and some fundamental work in the technical literature. Magazine articles and the worldwide web www generally cover the overall features. Students in this course will have an opportunity to explore the latest advances in manufacturing processes first hand, which would otherwise takeyears before it appears in textbooks. Where appropriate, industry experts will provide guest presentations and an on-site tour may be incorporated. No required textbook; only reference material.Topics covered in this course may include, purification of materials electro-slag remelting ESR, vacuum melting, zone refining, melting to remove tramp elements; precision casting; densification of materials conventional sintering, reaction sintering, hot-pressing, hot-isostatic pressing; directional solidification and growth of single crystals Czochralski process and Bridgeman technique; mechanical alloying; liquid phase infiltration; net-shaped finishing; superplastic forming; processing of nanocrystalline materials sol-gel processing; float glass or flat glass processing; tape laying; microwave processing; laser processing; ultraprecision machining UPM and ultraprecision grinding UPG; polishing and lapping; engineered surfaces and surface modification CVD and PVD sputtering and ion plating coatings including multilayer coatings; and layer processing for electronic materials. These and other topics the students may choose are rarely exposed, if at all, and definitely not at the same depth, to typical engineering students. You will receive a list of some 20 case studies as examples and a one-page description of each topic outlining the resources available, such as U. S. Patents or technical literature, as guidelines. You are free to choose any topic from this list or some other topic of interest. In most cases, students pick additional topics. This is an open ended course where students receive the opportunity to select a topic of interest dealing with advanced processing, prepare a patent search, analyze patents, prepare a technical report, and present the results in a power point presentation PPT format to the entire class. This way, in addition to acquiring knowledge on various manufacturing processes and materials, students improve upon their analytical and communicational skills both written and oral. Students have the option to form a team of two or work individually. During the span of the course,-conduct three case studies. Each case study takes 4-5 weeks.-Each week, make a PPT on the progress of your work and-on the last week of each case study, make final presentations and submit technical reports.At the beginning of the course, the students were given a list of anticipated ABET program outcomes. Depending on the topic chosen by a particular student, the relevance of these outcomes vary. At the end of the semester, the students are given a questionnaire, which is essentially the same as the outcomes given at the beginning of the course. The only difference is after each outcome, two items were included, namely, students analysis before and after the course in a scale of 1-10 for self-assessment. These are anonymous and submitted to the Secretary. That way confidentiality is maintained.Prerequisite: Engineering 86.",

This course investigates a number of contemporary shifts in the organization of work, including the rise of neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the feminization of the paid labor force, the prevalence of precarious work, contemporary forms of labor migration, and the expansion of prison labor. Locating these shifts in the longer histories and geographies of unfree labor, students will examine some of the ways in which workers have used their labor as a departure point for collective action, including unionization, work refusals, and struggles over social reproduction.",

From diseases to governmentpolicy, modeling techniques are being used to predict outcomes and manage populations. With the adventof more computational power and data collection, novel model types and techniques for analysis are being derived. We will explore current models and techniques which are used across multiple disciplines. We will consider agent-based or individual-based modeling, and ordinary differential equation models with parameter estimation, along with additional topics. Students will have achance to investigate using analytical and computational skills, that can be applied across a diversity of fields.",

Close reading begins, not with the question, What do these words mean but instead, the question, What do these words say  And then, What if these words mean just what they say  And then, What would have to be true about the world in which this poem or story operates in order for these words to mean just what they say  Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates.  It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see this worldthe actual, real, or historical worldin its capacity to be otherwise.  Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado.  We will watch a few films Hitchcocks Rope and Lamorisses The Red Balloon and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts e.g. T.J. Clark.",

The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data CHILDES. The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included with the expectation that students will have taken at least one. But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they dont have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora. Letter grade only. Prerequisites: LGCS105  PO or LGCS118 PO or LGC124  PO or permission from instructor.",

Students will understand the roles research, expertise, and strategic communications play in shaping public policy. In this class, students will research a contemporary policy issue and develop a policy research brief drawing on existing data sets and original analysis. The RJI Policy and Issues Briefs will be published quarterly, widely disseminated and posted on the RJI Policy Lab webpage.  In the fall of 2021, the course and lab will focus on environmental justice and environmental policy issues. While the readings cover environmental justice issues widely, we will center our analysis and work around local environmental justice work in the Inland Empire.

A key goal of the course is, beyond the broad content focus on questions of race, migration, xenophobia, class, and DEI, to offer an alternative view of these topics beyond the US-American debate. Many students are doubtlessly already acquainted with the latter, and the course provides a new lens on these questions through the cultural historical parameters of a different countryculture.

In so doing ,we ask: in a globalized world, how do gender, race, ethnicity, class, and colonialist legacies influence the questions raised and the solutions offered in response to African environmental issues Letter grade only.",

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and ones place in it; it typcally blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the essayistic and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the essay does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, ChrisMarker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Agns Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and JaTovia Gary.",

In mapping European and American musics queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowies and Princes gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA roots of Disco and House EDM, and more.

            "description": "Geometry of big data, including geometric deep learning, is a new field of machine learning and big data analytics that can visualize and learn from complex data like graphs and multi-dimensional points. Most deep learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning, attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. This course includes two components, 1 geometric data analysis and 2 geometric deep learning. For 1, students will learn geometric aspects of image analysis, pattern analysis and shape analysis and the approach of multivariate statistics that treats arbitrary data sets as clouds of points in n-dimensional space. For 2, students will learn how to apply traditional machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks to 3D objects, graphs and manifolds to solve problems including classifying nodes with similar characteristics on graphs, 3D object classification using point clouds, and 3D shape correspondence on 2D images. Prerequisites: MATH019  HM, MATH062  HM, MATH073  HM, and CSCI005  HM. Concurrent enrollment in MATH142  HM recommended but not required.",

Through close readings of key works in historical, sociological, anthropological, and political analyses of whitenesswhitening, settler colonialismrepublicanism, racial formation, and critical race theory, this class examines the development of European diasporas in the Americas as products of conquest, settler colonialism, trans-Atlantic slavery, and the Enlightenment; the uses and consequences of whiteness and whitening ideologies; and the political uses of whiteness and its consequences in public policy.

But the old ghosts are back--Russia on the rise, democracy questioned, inequalities reminiscent of the Gilded Age. One of those ghosts is Karl Marx, who has reappeared to haunt the present. But he wrote in the 19th century, for an audience of a different time and place. So the question arises: what remains relevant from his writings What do we salvage and what do we discard Reading him intensively, with an eye to present conundrums, and in concert with Thomas Piketty, we will attempt to answer some of those questions together.",
